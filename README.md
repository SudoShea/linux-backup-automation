# 🛡️ Linux Backup Automation

[![Ansible Lint](https://github.com/SudoShea/linux-backup-automation/actions/workflows/lint.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/SudoShea/linux-backup-automation/actions/workflows/lint.yml)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

An enterprise-grade, modular Ansible role that deploys automated, encrypted, deduplicated backups using **Restic** and offsite replication using **Rclone** managed via native **systemd** timers.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Restic Engine:** Fast, deduplicated, authenticated, and encrypted (`AES-256`) local/remote snapshots.
* **Automated Retention:** Enforces prune policies (7 daily, 4 weekly, 12 monthly, 1 yearly).
* **Multi-Cloud Offsite Sync:** Integrated `rclone` synchronisation supporting SFTP, Google Drive, Backblaze B2, AWS S3, and Google Cloud Storage.
* **Native Systemd Integration:** Service and timer units replace legacy crontabs for reliable scheduling, journald logging, and failure handling.
* **CLI Restore Helper Utility:** Ships an interactive helper (`restic-restore.sh`) to `/usr/local/bin` for quick snapshot browsing and file restoration.
* **Independent & Standalone:** Can be imported into any Ansible workflow or run as a standalone deployment.

---

## 📋 Requirements

* **Target OS:** Debian / Ubuntu, RedHat / RHEL / Fedora.
* **Ansible Core:** `>= 2.15`
* **Privileges:** Root / `sudo` access on target nodes for package installation and systemd unit management.

## ⚡ Quick Start (Standalone Usage)

### 1. Install the Role
You can add this role to your project via `requirements.yml`:
```yaml
roles:
  - name: linux_backup_automation
    src: git+https://github.com/SudoShea/linux-backup-automation.git
    version: main
```
or clone it directly into your `roles/` directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SudoShea/linux-backup-automation.git roles/linux_backup_automation
```
### 2. Create a Playbook (`deploy-backups.yml`)
```yaml
---
- hosts: backup_targets
  become: true
  roles:
    - role: linux_backup_automation
      vars:
        restic_repository: "/var/backups/restic"
        restic_password: "{{ vault_restic_password }}"
        restic_paths_to_backup:
          - "/etc"
          - "/var/www"
          - "/var/lib/containers"
        rclone_offsite_targets:
          - name: "gdrive-offsite"
            type: "drive"
            path: "Backups/restic"
            client_id: "{{ vault_gdrive_client_id }}"
            client_secret: "{{ vault_gdrive_client_secret }}"
            token: "{{ vault_gdrive_token }}" 
```
### 3. Run the Playbook
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory deploy-backups.yml --ask-vault-pass
```
---

## 🔐 Secrets & Password Management
This role handles two sensitive items that should always be encrypted using **Ansible Vault**:
1. **Restic Repository Password**: Deployed to `/etc/restic/password` with `0600` permissions. Passed via `restic_password`.
2. **Rclone Configuration Tokens**: Rendered into `/etc/rclone/rclone.conf` with `0600` permissions. Passed via individual provider variables or raw token JSON strings.

---

## 🔄 Restoring Backups
The role automatically installs a CLI restore utility on managed target hosts at `/usr/local/bin/restic-restore.sh`.

To interactively view snapshots or restore files on a host:
```bash
# Interactively list snapshots and select items to restore
sudo restic-restore.sh

# Or use standard Restic commands directly
sudo restic -r /var/backups/restic --password-file /etc/restic/password snapshots
sudo restic -r /var/backups/restic --password-file /etc/restic/password restore latest --target /tmp/restore-test
```
